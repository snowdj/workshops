    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists are known and celebrated for modeling and visually\n",
    "displaying information, but down in the data science engine room there\n",
    "is a lot of less glamorous work to be done. Before data can be used\n",
    "effectively it must often be cleaned, corrected, and reformatted. This\n",
    "workshop introduces the basic tools needed to make your data behave,\n",
    "including data reshaping, regular expressions and other text\n",
    "manipulation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an intermediate/advanced R course appropriate for those with\n",

    "=============================\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the workshop you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- install R from <https://cran.r-project.org/>\n",
    "- install RStudio from <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>\n",
    "- install the tidyverse package in R with `install.packages(\"tidyverse\")` and attach it with `library(tidyverse)`\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the workshop:\n",
    "- Download and extract the materials from <http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/RDataManagement.zip>. \n",
    "- Open Rstudio and create a new project (`File ==> New Project ==> Existing Directory` and select the `RDataManagement` folder you downloaded and extracted earlier. \n",
    "- Open a new R script (`File ==> New File ==> R script`) and save it as `Notes.R`.\n",

    "government agency, research group, or other organizations and entities. Often\n",
